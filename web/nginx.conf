# NGINX Configuration for Static Web Application
# 
# This configuration file sets up an NGINX server to serve a static web application
# with optimized delivery and compression settings.
#
# Configuration Details:
# - server.listen: Configures the server to listen on port 80 (HTTP)
# - server.server_name: Sets the server name to 'localhost'
# - server.root: Defines the document root directory as '/usr/share/nginx/html'
# - server.index: Specifies 'index.html' as the default index file
#
# Location Blocks:
# - location /: Handles all incoming requests
#   - try_files: Attempts to serve the requested URI, then directory, then falls back to index.html
#   - This configuration supports client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs)
#
# Compression Settings:
# - gzip: Enables gzip compression to reduce bandwidth usage
# - gzip_vary: Adds 'Vary: Accept-Encoding' header for proper caching
# - gzip_min_length: Only compresses files larger than 1024 bytes
# - gzip_types: Specifies MIME types to be compressed including:
#   - text/plain, text/css, text/xml, text/javascript
#   - application/x-javascript, application/xml+rss
#   - application/javascript, application/json
#
# Use Case: Suitable for serving static websites and Single Page Applications
# Performance: Gzip compression typically reduces file sizes by 70-90% for text-based content
